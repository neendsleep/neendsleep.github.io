    " I was dependent on sleeping pills for a long time, one fine night my Insomnia led me to the Neend app. Since then I put on a story and fall into a deep slumber. Thanking my lucky stars that I found my NEEND.":" I was dependent on sleeping pills for a long time, one fine night my Insomnia led me to the Neend app. Since then I put on a story and fall into a deep slumber.

    "I used to spend a lot of my evening hours surfing the web, but when I stumbled upon the Neend YouTube channel, and decided to give it a try. I could not help, but download the app and use it regularly. It has a very nice and in-depth description of the scenery. Also, I loved the fact that it was narrated in my native language.":"I used to spend a lot of my evening hours surfing the web, but when I stumbled upon the Neend YouTube channel, and decided to give it a try.
